## Installation

### 1. Run Database Migrations

Execute the migration scripts in order:

```bash
# 1. Add assets field to assessments table
psql -U your_user -d your_db -f scripts/997-add-assets-field-to-assessments.sql

# 2. Create compliance assessment schema
psql -U your_user -d your_db -f scripts/996-create-compliance-assessment-schema.sql

# 3. Add menu item
psql -U your_user -d your_db -f scripts/995-add-compliance-assessment-menu-item.sql
```

### 2. Verify Installation

Check that tables were created:
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'compliance_%';
```

Expected output:

## Data Flow

### Assessment Creation Flow
```
User fills form
  ‚Üì
Adds multiple assets via search
  ‚Üì
Submits assessment
  ‚Üì
API generates unique ID (CA-YYYY-FRAMEWORK-XXXXX)
  ‚Üì
Stores in compliance_assessments table
  ‚Üì
Assessment auto-selected for control evaluation
```

### Control Assessment Flow
```
User selects compliance assessment
  ‚Üì
Adds controls (single or bulk)
  ‚Üì
Each control linked to compliance_assessment_id
  ‚Üì
System auto-calculates:
  - Total controls
  - Compliant controls
  - Non-compliant controls
  - Overall compliance score
  ‚Üì
Updates parent assessment statistics
```

### Gap Remediation Flow
```
Control assessment identifies gap
  ‚Üì
User creates gap remediation
  ‚Üì
Gap linked to:
  - compliance_assessment_id
  - control_assessment_id (which control found the gap)
  ‚Üì
User tracks remediation:
  - Assigns owner and team
  - Sets timelines
  - Updates progress
  - Adds implementation notes
  ‚Üì
Gap status: Open ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Closed
```

## Compliance Scoring Algorithm

```javascript
// Count controls by status
const totalControls = all controls
const compliantControls = controls where status = 'Compliant'
const partiallyCompliant = controls where status = 'Partially Compliant'

// Calculate score (partial compliance counts as 50%)
complianceScore = (
  (compliantControls + (partiallyCompliant * 0.5)) / totalControls
) * 100

// Example:
// Total: 100 controls
// Compliant: 60
// Partially Compliant: 20
// Non-Compliant: 20
// Score: (60 + (20 * 0.5)) / 100 * 100 = 70%
```

## Assessment ID Format

Compliance assessments use the following ID format:

```
CA-YYYY-FRAMEWORK-XXXXX

Examples:
CA-2024-ISO27-00001    (ISO 27001)
CA-2024-NISTCSF-00001  (NIST CSF)
CA-2024-PCIDSS-00001   (PCI DSS)
CA-2024-HIPAA-00001    (HIPAA)
```

Gap IDs use this format:
```
GAP-YYYY-XXXXX

Example: GAP-2024-00001
```

## Status Workflows

### Assessment Status
```
Planning ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Approved
```

### Control Implementation Status
```
Not Assessed ‚Üí Non-Compliant ‚Üí Partially Compliant ‚Üí Compliant
             ‚îî‚Üí Not Applicable
```

### Gap Remediation Status
```
Open ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Closed
    ‚îî‚Üí Deferred (for deprioritized items)
```

1. **Initial** - Ad-hoc processes
2. **Managed** - Documented and repeatable
3. **Defined** - Standardized across organization
4. **Quantitatively Managed** - Measured and controlled
5. **Optimizing** - Continuous improvement

## Supported Frameworks

The system supports all major regulatory frameworks:

- ISO 27001 (Information Security)
- NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework)
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry)
- HIPAA (Healthcare)
- SOC 2 (Service Organization Control)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- NESA UAE (National Electronic Security Authority)
- MAS TRM (Monetary Authority of Singapore)

## Views and Reports

### compliance_assessment_summary View

Pre-aggregated statistics for dashboards:

```sql
SELECT * FROM compliance_assessment_summary;
```

Returns:
- Assessment details
- Control counts
- Gap counts
- Asset counts
- Compliance score
- Timestamps

### assessments_with_assets View

Shows assessments with asset information:

```sql
SELECT * FROM assessments_with_assets;
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Assessment Planning
- Define clear scope and objectives
- Select relevant assets
- Identify appropriate framework
- Assign qualified assessor

### 2. Control Evaluation
- Use consistent assessment methods
- Document all evidence collected
- Be specific in findings and gaps
- Assign realistic maturity targets

### 3. Gap Remediation
- Prioritize by severity and business impact
- Assign clear ownership
- Set realistic timelines
- Track progress regularly
- Document lessons learned

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- Conduct regular re-assessments
- Review and update controls
- Monitor gap closure rates
- Analyze trends over time

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions via database
- **Audit Trail**: All changes timestamped with user info
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- **Cascade Deletes**: Deleting assessment removes all related controls and gaps

## Performance Optimization

- **Indexes**: GIN indexes on JSONB fields (assets, milestones, tags)
- **Statistics**: Pre-calculated in parent assessment table
- **Views**: Materialized aggregations for reporting
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk control insertion supported

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Controls not appearing in gap remediation dropdown

**Solution**: Ensure controls have `remediation_required = true` or `gap_severity != 'None'`

### Issue: Compliance score not updating

**Solution**: Control assessment updates trigger automatic recalculation. Check API logs for errors.

### Issue: Cannot delete assessment

**Solution**: Cascade delete is enabled. Verify no orphaned records with foreign key constraints.

### Issue: Assets not appearing in assessment

**Solution**: 
1. Ensure assets field in GET endpoint includes assets
2. Check JSONB parsing in frontend
3. Verify assets were saved correctly in database

## Integration Points

### With Asset Management
- Asset search component fetches from `assets` table
- Multiple assets can be associated with assessments
- Asset data is stored as JSONB array

### With User Management
- Owner search component fetches from `users` table
- Assessors, reviewers, owners, assigned-to fields
- Department search for organizational assignment

### With Findings System
- Gap remediation can reference findings
- Evidence can link to finding documentation
- Shared severity and priority classifications
