## Usage Guide

### Creating a Policy Version
1. Navigate to the Policies section
2. Edit an existing policy
3. Click "Create Version" to save changes as a new version
4. Add a change summary describing what changed
5. The system automatically creates a new version number

### Uploading Files
1. Go to the File Management section
2. Click "Upload File"
3. Select a policy to associate the file with
4. Optionally select a specific version
5. Choose the file and add a description
6. The system handles deduplication and metadata tracking

### Viewing Policy-Procedure Relationships
1. Access the Policy-Procedure Mapping section
2. Switch between Grid and List views
3. Click on any mapping to see detailed information
4. View execution statistics and success rates
5. Monitor active executions and performance metrics

## Security Features

### File Upload Security
- **Hash-based Deduplication**: Prevents storage of duplicate files
- **File Type Validation**: Restricts uploads to allowed file types
- **Size Limits**: Configurable file size restrictions
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Secure file path handling

### Audit Trail
- **Complete Activity Logging**: All policy and file operations are logged
- **User Attribution**: All actions are attributed to specific users
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Precise timing of all operations
- **Immutable Records**: Audit logs cannot be modified

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexing
- Optimized indexes on frequently queried columns
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

### Query Optimization
- Efficient pagination for large datasets
- Selective field loading
- Cached metadata calculations

### File Management
- Lazy loading of file previews
- Optimized file type detection
- Efficient search indexing

## Future Enhancements
